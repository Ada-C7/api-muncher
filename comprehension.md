| How did you go about exploring the Edamam API, how did you try querying the API? | I read the docs, and searched a few recipes. I plugged different things into the link to see what it would return.  |
| Describe your API Wrapper.  How did you decide on the methods you created? | I decided that I needed a method to get the recipes based on the query, and a method to list a selected recipe's ingredients/nutrition.  |
| Describe an edge case or failure case test you wrote for your API Wrapper. |  |
| Explain how VCR aids in testing an API. | VCR's allow us to record our interactions with an API and replay them. This allows us to limit the number of API calls we make.  |
| What is the Heroku URL of your deployed application? | https://protected-woodland-43975.herokuapp.com/ |
| Do you have any recommendations on how we could improve this project for the next cohort? | Some of the articles and info given for this week's material would have been useful to have a couple weeks ago.
